# async-profiler-actuator
 - [AsyncProfiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler) is a proven tool for troubleshooting Java applications in variety of situations.
 - [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) is an extremely popular platform for building production ready Java applications.

The idea behind this small library is the integration of AsyncProfiler in form of a Spring Boot actuator.

Originally, [issue #23988](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/23988) has been opened to integrate this directly into Spring Boot back in year 2020. Later in 2024 it was suggested that this functionality is better to be implemented as an external add-on to Spring Boot. So, this is an attempt to do so.
